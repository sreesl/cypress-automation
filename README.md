##Why use Cypress

Cypress is the best answer to what if we can use the same tool for UI testing to also test APIs.
  
* No other dependencies required to run tests as Cypress contains everything you need.
* Setup is minimal
* Cypress supports BDD and TDD style assertion.
* We can add a visual test runner for our API tests and also run it headlessly on the command line.
