##Why use Cypress

* No other dependencies required to run tests as Cypress contains everything you need.
* Setup is minimal
* Cypress supports BDD and TDD style assertion syntax so this would already be familiar to engineers who have used other JavaScript testing libraries.
* Cypress Test Runner useful in debugging your tests. You can also directly inspect from Chrome dev tools.
